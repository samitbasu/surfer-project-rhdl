A waveform viewer with a focus on a snappy usable interface, and extensibility.

## Installation

If you just want to try things out, you can try surfer right in the web-browser
at <https://app.surfer-project.org/>. However, performance is a bit worse than
native, and some features are missing so for day-to-day use it is recommended
to install the native version.

The primary way to install surfer to build it from source which should work on
Linux, Mac and Windows. For convenience we also provide a pre-built Linux
binary.

### Compiling from source

Surfer depends on openssl, install it via your package manager

#### Debian/Ubuntu

```bash
sudo apt install openssl
sudo apt install libssl-dev
```

#### Fedora

```bash
sudo dnf install openssl
sudo dnf install openssl-devel
```

#### Arch

```bash
sudo pacman -S openssl
```

Then, install [Rust via Rustup](https://rustup.rs) and run

```bash
cargo install --git https://gitlab.com/surfer-project/surfer surfer
```

You can also install the latest version of `surfer` via the [AUR](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Arch_User_Repository) package [`surfer-waveform-git`](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/surfer-waveform-git).

To compile a version in your local repo without installing it anywhere:

```bash
git clone git@gitlab.com:surfer-project/surfer.git
cd surfer
git submodule update --init --recursive
cargo build
```

If all goes well, the `surfer` executable can found in `./target/debug/`.
You can run it from there, or you can use `cargo run`.

You can install your own version of surfer with `cargo install --path .`.

### Pre-built Linux binary

You can download a pre-built Linux binary
[here](https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/42073614/jobs/artifacts/main/raw/surfer_linux.zip?job=linux_build).
It is built on a Debian system with some dynamically linked libs, so it may
not work on all systems.

### Pre-built Windows binary

You can download a pre-built Windows binary
[here](https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/42073614/jobs/artifacts/main/raw/surfer_win.zip?job=windows_build).

Note that sometimes Windows Defender has been known to report Surfer [and other rust projects](https://github.com/cargo-bins/cargo-binstall/issues/945) as a trojan. If in doubt, please use [Virus total](https://www.virustotal.com/) to check.

### Pre-built macos-aarch64 binary

You can download a pre-built macos-aarch64 binary
[here](https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/42073614/jobs/artifacts/main/raw/surfer_macos-aarch64.zip?job=macos-aarch64_build).

## Configuration

Many aspects of Surfer can be configured.
To learn more about configuration, have a look at our [wiki](https://gitlab.com/surfer-project/surfer/-/wikis/Configuration).

## Development Information

Contributions to Surfer are very welcome! See the
[list of issues](https://gitlab.com/surfer-project/surfer/-/issues) if you do not have any
suggestions on your own. Some basic [development information](https://gitlab.com/surfer-project/surfer/-/wikis/home)
is available.

## Project Status

Surfer is still in early development, but it is in a usable state. In fact, if
you are able to take advantage of the extensibility such as with the
[Spade](https://spade-lang.org) integration, you may even prefer it to the alternatives.
